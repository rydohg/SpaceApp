            <h3>What are they?</h3>
            <p>A gas giant is a large planet composed mostly of gases, such as hydrogen and helium, with a relatively small rocky core.</p>
            <p>These are typically the biggest planets in a solar system. They are made out of the remnants of disk of gas that orbits a newly formed star. </p>
